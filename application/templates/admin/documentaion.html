    <h1>Welcome Admin Section Documentation</h1>

    <h3 class="headers">To access administration page</h3>
    <p>To access the admin page you must first be login in as an administrator.</p>

    <h3 class="headers">Create a new user</h3>
    <p>To create a new user simply click on the create option in the users section of the admin page and the fill in
        the required information and assign the role to the user either as a teacher or as an administrator. Note that
        by default the user has a role as a student. This default behaviour occurs only when the user registers using
        the registration form in the main page. Creating a user following this method is not advised since the user
        password will not get encrypted making the data not secure. Instead create a user through the normal
        registration form and then assign the role to the specific user using the admin panel. Read on how to assign
        roles to users.</p>

    <h3 class="headers">Assign roles</h3>
    <p>To assign a role to a user click on the users link in the admin panel then click the pen like icon, this will
        take you to the page with that users specific information. You will see two check boxes there now select the
        role you want to assign the user.</p>

    <h3 class="headers">Assign Administration roles</h3>
    <p>To give a user administrative role the current admin simply needs to turn on the is_admin field to true under
        the users section.</p>

    <h3 class="headers">To delete users with role as a teacher</h3>
    <p>You can only delete a user who created a post after and only after you have deleted his or her posts since a
        post canâ€™t exist without an author.</p>
